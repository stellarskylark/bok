.SH NAME
bok \- manage personal journals
.SH SYNOPSIS
.SY bok
.RI < command >
.RI [ arg ]
.YS
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B bok
is a simple shellscript for the management of personal journals.

.B bok
stores your journal as a directory tree rooted in
.IR $BOK_DIR ,
which is
.I ~/journal
by default.
The entry for any particular date is a text file at
.IR $BOK_DIR/YEAR/MONTH/DAY .
For example, the entry for April 20, 2020 would be found in
.IR $BOK_DIR/2020/04/20 .

Each journal file will begin with the date as its first line.
The second line of the file is reserved for whitespace-separated
.IR tags ,
which are useful for categorizing your journal entries.

The journal opens up for viewing in
.BR less ,
with custom keybindings applied via
.BR lesskey .
The config for these is found at
.IR $BOK ,
which is
.I ~/.bokrc
by default.

.SY l
next entry

scroll down
.SY k
scroll up
.SY q
quit
.YS

.SH BUGS

Opening an entry with
.B bok view
results in the first entry having some text like ":2" shown at the beginning of the file.
Flipping to another entry and back, this text will no longer appear.

If you already use a custom
.B lesskey
configuration, opening the view dialog in
.B bok
will restore the default keybindings.
